# Crop-Recommendation-System-Using-Python-and-Scikit-learn
## Description
This was my Final Project during the **Epoch X IOTA DS Bootcamp**. Based on the features, I have created a model that can predict what crop to grow.\
It has an accuracy of 99.55%. I used the RandomForest Ml model.
## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this analysis includes the following features:\
**N**: Nitrogen content in the soil (in parts per million).\
**P**: Phosphorus content in the soil (in parts per million).\
**K**: Potassium in the soil (in parts per million).\
**Temperature**: Temperature in degrees Celsius.\
**Humidity**: Humidity in percentage.\
**pH**: Soil pH value.\
**Rainfall**: Rainfall in mm.\
**Label**: The crop type historically grown under these conditions.\
